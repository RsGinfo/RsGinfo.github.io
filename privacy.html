        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <div class="last-updated">Last updated: August 2025</div>

        <h2><strong>Note on Parental Access to Data</strong></h2>

            <p>We do not collect personal information from users. We only gather anonymous technical data such as crash reports and feature usage counts that cannot be linked back to individuals. COPPA grants parents rights to access or delete personal information, but because none is collected, there's nothing applicable under those rights.</p>
            
            <p>If you have concerns or believe your child has provided personal information, please contact us at suppeyes@gmail.com.</p>

        </ul>
        <p>These services have their own privacy policies, and we encourage you to review them.</p>

        <h2>9. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Our app is designed to be suitable for users of all ages, including children as young as 3, in accordance with the Google Play age rating.</li>
            
            <li>We do not knowingly collect any personal information (such as name, email, phone number, or location) from children.</li>

            <li>We do not collect Android Advertising ID, IMEI, precise location, or other device identifiers from children.</li>
            
            <li>We retain children's data only as long as needed for app functionality and then delete it securely.</li>

            <li>The app may collect anonymous technical data such as device type, app version, crash reports, and basic usage statistics.</li>
            
            <li>This data is used only to improve the app’s performance and user experience and cannot be used to identify individual users.</li>
            
            <li>If advertising is displayed in the app, it is provided through non-personalized ads that do not track or profile users.</li>
            
            <li>Parents and guardians are encouraged to supervise their child’s use of the app.</li>

            , and we will promptly delete it.</li>

            <li>We do not transmit Android Advertising ID or other device identifiers for children where prohibited by Google Play Families policy. For mixed-audience scenarios, ad requests for children or users of unknown age are tagged as child-directed to disable interest-based ads.</li>
            <li>Because we do not collect personal information from children and only process anonymous technical signals, there is no personal data available for parental access or review. If you believe personal information was provided accidentally, contact us at suppeyes@gmail.com and we will delete it promptly.</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>10. International Data Transfers</h2>
